### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance data visualization engineer, focusing on high-performance geospatial and node-link graph visualizations.

When developing using open-source libraries, we stand on the shoulders of other people, who made their code publicly available before us. I believe itâ€™s important to keep the ball rolling, to keep improving. Fixing bugs that were left unresolved for a long time, implementing new features, or filling the gaps by creating completely new libraries.

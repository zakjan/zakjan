### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance data visualization engineer, focusing on high-performance geospatial and node-link graph visualizations.

When developing using open-source libraries, we stand on the shoulders of other people, who made their code publicly available before us. I believe itâ€™s important to keep the ball rolling, to keep improving. Fixing bugs that were left unresolved for a long time, implementing new features, or filling the gaps by creating completely new libraries.

Follow me on Twitter [@zakjan](https://twitter.com/zakjan) for updates about my work. If you are considering sponsoring my open-source contributions, please check [my GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/zakjan).
